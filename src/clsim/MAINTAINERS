# I have no idea what format this file will have once the automatic
# maintainer commit authorization check will be in place. I am going
# with
#
# "svn username" "email1" "email2" ...
#
# for now. (with the email addresses being optional) This will probably need to be changed.
#
# If you want to be added to this list, just let any maintainer know.
