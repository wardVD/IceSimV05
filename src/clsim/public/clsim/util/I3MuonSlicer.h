/**
 * @brief takes an MC tree with a muon that has been
 * propagated using MMC (i.e. a muon with cascades as daughter
 * particles). It chops the muon track into slices 
 * with estimated energies. All the original muon
 * will be retained and all slices will be added to
 * the muon as daughter particles. So you will end up with
 * a long muon track with cascades and shorter muons
 * as daughter particles. Make sure your light propagation
 * knows how to handle this (you run the risk of having light
 * generated twice, once for the parent (=long) track and
 * again for the daughters muon tracks).
 *
 * I3CLSimModule knows how to deal with these tracks.
 *
 * The muon starting/stopping points and energies are taken
 * from an I3MMCTrackList object in case it exists
 * and a name is configured.
