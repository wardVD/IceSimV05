This direcotry contains a colelction of various IceCube ice models,
such as WHAM!, Spice-MIE some others. They are straight copies from
ppc, photonics or the IceCube wiki. If in doubt, download the ice model
files yourself and point clsim to them.

Clsim is fully compatible with photonics and ppc ice model files
(although ppc model files should yield a slightly higher performance
on GPUs since they use a parameterized ice model instead of a
interpolated table of values).
