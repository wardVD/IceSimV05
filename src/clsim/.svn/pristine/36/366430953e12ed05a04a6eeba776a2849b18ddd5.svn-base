=========

The conventional method of sampling the arrival time distribution of photons
on photo-detectors in large-volume neutrino detectors is based on large,
interpolated look-up tables. Generating such tables and finding robust interpolation
methods has proven to be highly non-trivial. Existing tools such as *ptd*,
Photonics_ (recently combined with improved interpolation methods in
Photospline_) and *km3* all perform reasonable well. They all do, however,
have drawbacks, such as binning artifacts, incomplete descriptions of the detector
medium, large memory requirements and so on. All of those tools have to rely on
interpolation, requiring careful fine-tuning of parameters during the generation
of their respective photon tables. Finally, generating photon tables usually
takes a comparably long time, making such tools inconvenient for systematic
studies, where properties such as the absorption or scattering lengths need
to be changed frequently. Usually, changing any parameter requires a full
table re-generation.

The *clsim* photon tracker aims to work around these problems by tracking
each single photon generated by a given source in the detector. This very
time-consuming process can be sped up by factors of over 100 by using GPU
hardware instead of CPUs. This has first been proven by tools like *i3mcml*
and *ppc*. Instead of the vendor-specific CUDA framework used by those
tools, *clsim* uses OpenCL with the aim of being portable to other architectures,
such as AMD/ATI or even multi-core CPUs.
