The Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~

* `I3IsolatedHitsCutModule <../../doxygen/DomTools/classI3IsolatedHitsCutModule.html>`_ - This selection module rejects all responses (I3RecoHit, I3RecoPulse, I3MCHit or I3DOMLaunch, see I3OMSelection) which are temporal and/or spatially isolated.
* `I3FirstPulsifier <../../doxygen/DomTools/classI3FirstPulsifier.html>`_ - This module takes a regular pulse series map as input and returns a pulse series map that has only the first pulses in it.
* `I3LCCleaning <../../doxygen/DomTools/classI3LCCleaning.html>`_ - This module splits an I3DOMLaunchSeriesMap into two maps.  One of which contains only HLC launches, the other of which contains only SLC launches.
* `I3DOMLaunchCleaning <../../doxygen/DomTools/classI3DOMLaunchCleaning.html>`_ - Cleans out launches according to user define input like "CleanedKeys" and "CleanedKeysList" which are lists of OMKeys (the latter being a frame object).  This is mostly for cleaning out bad DOMs.
* `I3TimeWindowCleaning <../../doxygen/DomTools/classI3TimeWindowCleaning.html>`_ - For a user defined time window this module maximizes the number of hits in that time window and cleans out any outside hits.
* `I3OMSelection <../../doxygen/DomTools/classI3OMSelection.html>`_ - Seems to perform a similar task to I3DOMLaunchCleaning except it has instantiatons for both I3DOMLaunches and I3RecoPulses, though it's not used for I3DOMLaunches.
* `I3Coincify <../../doxygen/DomTools/classI3Coincify.html>`_ -  This module applies Hard Local Coincidence to all time-like responses : I3RecoPulse, I3RecoHit, I3MCHit, and I3DOMLaunch.
