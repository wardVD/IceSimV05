# A script designed to produce events containing only noise triggers. Contains
# both a normal tray segment (with everything except a random module and an
# I3Writer) and an iceprod module for SimProd generation.
#
# Each event produced will initally be a 100 ms long frame of noise. This will
# be triggered and then cut down using CoincidenceAfterProcessing from trigger-sim
# to create normal-sized events.

    ProduceNoiseTriggers: Create events containing only noise and no simulated particle interactions. These

    are some nuances to this. All events must be long in order to avoid problems at the edge of simulated
    events where expanding around the triggers could include unsimulated regions in time. All frames are
    initially 100 ms long. These are triggered, then cut down by CoincidenceAfterProcessing to be more
    reasonable lengths.
