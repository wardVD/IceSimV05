trunk 
=====
r142071 - Copy the OMKey when making LC connected neighbors.  This preserves the PMT number
          so no change for IceCube proper, but for future mDOM simulations this is slighty saner.

Release Notes
=============

Changes since V00-00-06

* Added a small python function module for and effective dom simluation by converting
  MCPulses to RecoPules and add additional jitter to the charge and time of the pulse.
* Updated the examples so that they work now.
* Added more checks to prevent a crash when someone gives us a pointless empty DOM entry.
* Fixed PMTResponseSimulator gcd test to fail properly for 0 voltage DOMs instead of throwing.
* Added warning if one tries to simulate a frame that is more than 60 seconds long.
* Disabled PMTResponseSimulator module pybindings (to prevent icetray inspect of crashing)
* Fixed a bug with circular references which meant that all memory was not freed when
  the DOMLauncher module was destroyed. This would cause a memory leak if the DOMLauncher
  module was reinstantiated in a lopp for example.
* No empty launch series are written out.
* The beacon launch phase changes between events

V00-00-06

* Fixed the double flooring of the baseline which caused a lower than
  expected extracted charge compared to the input charge.

V00-00-05

* Updated DOMLauncher module docs. (work in progress)
* Enableing an optimization in the discriminator that was left out by
  mistake in the last release. Speeds up the discriminator part and lowers
  the memory footprint since no duplicataed discriminator crossings are
  generated anymore.
* Reintroduce and active DOM maps to speed up simulation that only
  simulates a fraction of the detector.
* Recognizes I3_TESTDATA.
* Fixed pulse merging in the WaveformEvaluator class and introduced a
  cutoff at 500us for evaluating pulses in the past which significantly
  improves computational time.
* Added BufferedWaveformEvaluator class that buffers up to 500us
  (can be adjusted) of pulses from previous frames.
* Replaced all instances of manual waveform evaluation in the code and
  replaced it with the newBufferedWaveformEvaluator.
* MultiFrameEvents simulation works now as expected. This required some
  small changes/fixes in how the DOM updates its state and the introduction
  of the above mentioned BufferedWaveformEvaluator.
* Added tests to test MultiFrameEvents simulation.
* Simulation of so-called beacon launches added. Also a new configuration
  options were added to set the beacon launch rate and whether they should be
  simulated at all.

V00-00-04

Added release notes for this project.

* Added RapCal time calibration uncertainty to the simulation. A script which shows
  the effect of shifting the DOMLaunch time stamp was added as well.
* Removed dom_type enum since it was redundant.
* Fixed the clock cycle phase setting so the DOM only gets a new phase when it is reset and
  not every time the Discriminator method is called.
* Adjusted and added comments.
* Reintroduced configurable global state for I3DOM. Now the proper way of constructing an
  I3DOM is to provide both a reference to a globalTime variable and a pulse template map.
* A class for evaluating the folded waveform which merges the pulses in the tails was added.
* SuperNovaMode has changed. Now the only effect is that enables Discriminator over threshold output.
* MultiFrameEvents option has been added DOMLauncher should simulate events spanning several frames.

  .. note:: This option is in an experimental stage and is not working properly yet!
