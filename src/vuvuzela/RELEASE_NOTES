Release Notes
=============

On the trunk
------------

* Removed dependence on I3MCEventHeaderGenerator

July 22, 2015 Michael Larson (mjlarson@nbi.ku.dk)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Apparently forgot to change the default values for each of the 
  noise parameters. These only affect PINGU/HEX DOMs and DOMs that are
  missing a good calibration record. The default values are now set to
  the median values as measured by IC86 good-fit DOMs.

July 3, 2015 Michael Larson (mjlarson@nbi.ku.dk)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added support for the short-timescale noise that wasn't supported 
  previously in Vuvuzela. To this end, a new option was added to 
  enable/disable the low-dt distribution. New noise parameters were
  added in the resources/data/ directory and those will be used by 
  default for the tray segment. 
* Removed the "ForceRelativeToZero" option, which was unused.
* Small change from log_warn to log_info in the Finish() method

Release V01-00-05

* Updated gcd_test to exclude IceTop DOMs.

Going to get serious about release notes for individual projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a feature in Vuvuzela where DOMs lacking a good calibration 
record were not being simulated by the tray segment. While this was
intentional at the time to avoid spending time simulating bad DOMs, 
it caused problems for PINGU simulation using the tray segment. The 
fix was to switch the segment to run all DOMs by default, producing 
good DOMs, bad DOMs, and "new" DOMs for all events. This has been
tested with both PINGU and IceCube simulation and both work as expected.

Also noted was that the default values for each of the five parameters
were set using an old version of the Vuvuzela fits. These default 
values have been updated to use the median fit value for each parameter. 
These parameters are only used for DOMs lacking a good calibration
record and should not affect any IceCube or DeepCore simulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Added an option for the Supernova guys so that they can produce using
absolute times for hits measured from the I3EventHeader instead of times 
relative to t=0 (which is how normal IceCube simulation is done). This 
shouldn't affect anyone else.
