Release Notes
=============

trunk
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add a local cache for normalization info to avoid melting the 
  iceprod database, and make NuGen normalizations picklable again
* Add a NuGenWeightCalculator for weighting NuGen simulation, and
  rename WeightCalculator to CORSIKAWeightCalculator
* WeightCalculator modules now take an optional NFiles parameter
* Add "new" CR flux parameterizations Honda2004 and TIG1996
* from_simprod() no longer attempts to guess the number of files in a dataset.
  This means that you now have to calculate the number of files by hand, but
  file counting had become so unreliable that you were likely to have been
  doing so anyway.

Release V00-00-01

* fluxes.py and weighting.py are both properly found in the weighting project
* Deal with newer sets that use real CORSIKA.
* Detect when dataset.jobs_completed is a lie, and fall back to counting jobs.
* Uses PDG codes by default.
