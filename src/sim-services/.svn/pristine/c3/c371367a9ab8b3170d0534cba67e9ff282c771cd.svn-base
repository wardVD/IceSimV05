/**
 * @brief Splits an I3MCTree into two trees. One tree
 * will have all tracks set to shape "Dark", the other
 * one will have everything else set to "Dark".
 *
 * Can be used for hybrid simulations with two different
 * photon propagators, one for tracks and one for cascades.
 * (e.g. photonics/hit-maker and ppc).
 *
 * WARNING: Do not use this with current versions of PPC/IceTray!
 *          At the moment PPC will read *ALL* I3MCTrees from the
 *          frame and will simulate particles from all of them.
