Class and Namespace Overview
----------------------------

This project contains the following classes and namespaces.  

- `I3SimConstants <../../doxygen/sim-services/namespaceI3SimConstants.html>`_ - Namespace of various physics constants useful in simulation.
- `I3PropagatorService <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3PropagatorService.html>`_ - Abstract base class for lepton propagator services.
- `I3SumGenerator <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3SumGenerator.html>`_  - A class for generating the sum of several random numbers which all have the same probability density.
- `I3MCTreeHybridSimulationSplitter <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3MCTreeHybridSimulationSplitter.html>`_ - Splits an I3MCTree into two trees, one for tracks and one for cascades.
- `I3MCPEtoI3MCHitConverter <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3MCPEtoI3MCHitConverter.html>`_ - Converts an I3MCPESeriesMap to an I3MCHitSeriesMap.
- `I3DownsampleMCPE <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3DownsampleMCPE.html>`_ - Randomly downsample MCPEs from one collection to another.
- `I3PropagatorModule <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3PropagatorModule.html>`_ - Propagates all particles found in an MCTree.
- `I3InIceCORSIKATrimmer <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3InIceCORSIKATrimmer.html>`_ - Removes muons that have no chance of reaching the detector.
- `I3CombineMCPE <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3CombineMCPE.html>`_ - Combines several I3MCPEHitSeriesMaps into one.
- `I3RemoveLargeDT <../../doxygen/sim-services/classI3RemoveLargeDT.html>`_ - Removes outlying I3MCPEs.

Deprecated Modules
------------------
* I3ModifyEventID - This modified more than the event ID *and* it was actually only used to set the start time, so this has been replaced with I3ModifyStartTime.
