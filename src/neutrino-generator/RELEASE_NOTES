Release Notes
=============

JUN 24, 2015 Kotoyo Hoshina(hoshina@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* more tests added to avoid future error of PropagationWeight (see MAY 8 2015 note)
* Some parameters in I3MCWeightDict are renamed. To restore old parameter names, see resources/examples/NuGen.py. 
  See https://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/Neutrino_Generator/I3MCWeightDict for new parameters.

JUN 14, 2015 Kotoyo Hoshina(hoshina@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* code cleaning, test implementation of MuonRange extention for NuEBar at Grashow Resonance.
  When W decays into mu or tau (in total ~21 %), we need to extend detection volume, which wasn't done in old code.
  However, as long as we apply contained cascade cut at analysis level, this effect may be negligible. 
  old commit on 5/25(r133059) had a bug.

MAY 8, 2015 Kotoyo Hoshina(hoshina@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* VERY IMPORTANT BUGFIX for NuEBar CHANNEL (PropagationWeight was wrong) 
  all NuEBar simulations generated with the revision after 121996 (submitted on 7/25/2014) will be affected

December 10, 2014 Kotoyo Hoshina(hoshina@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* ListToTree function is modified to not fill duplicated particle(ID) in a MCTree
* Removed duplicated codes in I3NeutrinoGeneratorBase.cxx
* Added parentID (data member) to Particle class
* Particle::GetDaughters() function is changed to const, added AddDaughter() function
* Update I3NuGGenie to support genie 2.8.6 (does NOT compatible with old genie)

November 24, 2014 Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed a bug where 2 muons were created from one interacion
* Recognizes I3_TESTDATA

July 31, 2014 Kotoyo Hoshina (hoshina@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* InjectionRadius, ActiveLengthBefore(After), CylinderRadius, CylinderHeight are removed. 
  Use CylinderParams parameter instead.
* Bug fix in EnumTypeDef. Unused tests are removed.
* InjectionMode::Cylindere is renamed to InjectionMode::Surface, because
  NuGen don't know what the shape of sampling surface would be!
* Make "AUTODETECT" default for PropagationWeight 
 
July 22, 2014 Kotoyo Hoshina (hoshina@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Output format has been changed to I3Map<I3ParticleID, double> for SimMode = "InEarth" option 
* modified resources/util/DrawInEarthPropWeight.py to support both old format and new format
* fWorldRadius parameter is added to Steering class, which used to be in earthmodel-service.
  Users need to adjust the value if they want to inject neutrinos in large radius (>2km).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Release V01-03-00

* Muon range extension is settable.
* Only consider neutrinos for selection that actually pass through the sampling surface.
* Refactored NeutrinoGenerator into a worker base class, an I3Module, and an I3PropagatorService.
* Replaced explicit Cylinder with general SamplingSurface.
* Supports Corsika-NuGen generation.
* Injection particle direction bug is fixed.
* Download cross section files automatically.
