August 31, 2015, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
------------------------------------------------------

Release V15-08-00 

* I3MCTree converter is back. It's still useless, but apparently it found its
  way into PINGU processing.
* Allow converters to accept subclasses of their handled types. This makes it
  possible to book I3LinearizedMCTree, a thing that was blocked for no good
  reason.

March 15, 2015, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-----------------------------------------------------

Release V15-03-00 

* "weight" is now NPE and type uint64_t.

* No more converter for I3MCTree.  We'll start providing individual
  converters like "the primary"

November 20, 2014, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
