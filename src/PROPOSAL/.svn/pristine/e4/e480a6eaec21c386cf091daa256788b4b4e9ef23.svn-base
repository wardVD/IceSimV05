Introduction
------------

Leptons in PROPOSAL can have different interactions with the media they are in. These stochastic energy losses are:

- Ionization
- electron-Pairproduction
- Bremsstrahlung
- Photonuclear Interaction
- "Decay"

The decay is not a real stochastic loss, but is an interaction which the charged lepton can do. Below 1TeV the energyloss of muons is dominated by Ionization and above 1TeV by Pairproduction.

Not all interactions are simulated since this would requiere a lot of computing time. In PROPOSAL you can set an minimum energy for an stochastic loss which will then be calculated. This can be an absolute value or and relative value of the current particle energy. All energylosses below this limit are averaged over the propagated distance.
