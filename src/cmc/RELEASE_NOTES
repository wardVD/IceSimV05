To-do

V03-00-02 - Incremental release.

* Python 3 script cleanups.

June 18th, 2012 Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Big reorganization.  The main motivation was to make projects
  that depend on cmc not have to include gsl in their USE_TOOLS line.
  It's always a bit of a surprise to link to a project only to have
  that fail because you didn't include their tools as well.  That's
  just bad form.  So most classes are moved to private.  The only
  thing left in public is I3CascadeMCService.  Only the propagator
  service depends on explicitly building against it.

* The scripts work again and were never fully converted.  Welcome
  to the world of Q-frames!

* CMC wasn't handling pathological input very well. When the particle's
  energy is not normal ( literally !std::isnormal ) CMC would either
  abort or loop infinitely.  This is the cause of the following ticket :
  http://code.icecube.wisc.edu/projects/icecube/ticket/384
  When the particle's energy is not normal CMC now prints
  a warning and returns an empty list.
