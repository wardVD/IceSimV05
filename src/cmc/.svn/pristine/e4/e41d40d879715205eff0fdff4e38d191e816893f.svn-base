   @section Overview

   The cmc (Cascade Monte Carlo) module simulates the development
   of electro-magnetic showers in the ice.

   This module should be used after the neutrino-generator in case of
   electron neutrion samples. If you want to treat cascades from muon interactions,
   put into the MC tree by mmc, you need to run this module after mmc.
   But if you want to look at hadronic cascades and use this module for 
   generating muons, you have to run mmc after it.  

   The main documentation can be found here: http://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/Cascade_Simulation

   @section Parameter
   @param energythresholdsimulation
   Threshold energy to simulate the cascade development, rather than using a parametrization (Default: 1 PeV)

   @param energythresholdsplit
   Threshold energy for splitting a cascade (Default: 1 TeV)

   @param inputmctree
   Name of the MCTree/MCList in the frame to be used as input (Default: MCTree)

   @param outputmctree
   Name of the MCTree added to the frame with particles after splitting (Default: CMCTree)

   @param splitwidth
   Distance between individual sub-cascdes in units of radiation length (~36cm) (Default: 3)

   @todo improve treatment of hadronic showers, in particular fo extremly high energies
