--------------------------------------------------------------------

* clipAtEarthSurfice option is removed from several public functions.
* fEarthRadius parameter is removed and earthmodel-service no longer
  takes into account simulation volume (world volume)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Material properties are now read from data files. 
* RVector3 is no longer used. 
* The simple iceceap implementation was fixed; while the upper surface 
  of the glacier had the correct shape, layers within the ice were 
  Earth-centered spheres rather than being concentric with the ice surface. 
* The code for integrating the Earth density to convert bewteen 
  column depth and distance with more efficient implementations. For 
  the conversion of distance to column depth (where the endpoints 
  are known) Romberg integration is now used, and for conversion of 
  column depth to distance (where only one endpoint is known) 
  Runge-Kutta integration of the problem (rewritten as a differential 
  equation) is used. 
* The public interface now supports querying which material is found
  at a given point, and also checking the distance from a given point 
  along a given direction to the next boundary between materials.

Started project

This project manages density profile of the Earth and ice.
All propagation program except for mmc should refer this module 
to get density of the Earth at a given position x.
