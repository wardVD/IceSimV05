This directory contains configuration settings for various ice models.

All: some common files

Ice models by Kurt:
These are my (Dima) fits to photonics configuration tables made by Kurt. They
are mostly correct inside the detector at 400 nm and could deviate otherwise.

aha: legacy AHA as used in ppc (configured from AHA with g=0.94)
aha-fixed:  corrected AHA (configured from AHA with g=0.8, cf. cfg.txt)
wham: configured from WHAM! with g=0.80 model from WHAM! wiki page


Ice models by Dima:

sp1: SPICE 1 (or just "SPICE")
spx: last of the SPICE2 models before SPICE Mie
mie: SPICE Mie
lea: SPICE with l_e anisotropy
