This directory will contain the code for DirectFit. Also used for ice fits.

No support as yet, but if you'd like to try here are some directions.
1. compile the ppc.o in either ../gpu or ../ocl with make go or make oo
2. link to ppc.h: ln -s ../ppc.h
3. compile in this directory with make or make ocl

you will need to source src files in ../gpu or ../ocl and this directories.
the src files may need to be edited!

You will need to prepare the data file of your event. This is a text file
named "dat" with lines:
[str] [dom] [time] [charge]
e.g.: 73 20 12.5 1.3
This can be binned (in, e.g., 25 ns bins) or unbinned data. For multiple
repeated events the charge is average over all events.

Use as following:
export PPCTABLESDIR=../../../resources/ice/llh
[FLSH=dom,str] [MLPD=0/1] [SREP=sim. events] [DREP=dat. events] ./llh [method]

FLSH: set for flasher data, same conventions as for ppc
MLPT: use nnls-extraction for track (FLSH=0) or azmuth pattern (FLSH=1)
      reconstruction
SREP: usually 1. Simulate more events for more precise results
DREP: usually 1. Set for flasher data with repeated events (e.g., DREP=250)

You can fine-tune (or disable) GPUs with ppc env. variables NPHO and NPHO_[#].
Default is 1024 (photons per thread). For a faster GPU set to higher number,
e.g., NPHO_0=1792. To disable a GPU or device, set to 0: NPHO_4=0.

Also, for CUDA version, BADMP and BADMP_[#], and for OpenCL version, XMLT and
XMLT_[#]. Set to the highest integer that works without errors (default is 4).
