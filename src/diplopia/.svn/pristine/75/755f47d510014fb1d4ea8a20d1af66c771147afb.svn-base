Release Notes
=============
March 28, 2016 Juan Carlos Diaz Velez (juancarlos@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* Ported PoissonMerger to C++ Module.
* Removed obsolete modules including I3Polyplopia.
* Removed obsolete example scripts.
* Modified MPHitFilter to prune I3MCTree branches that don't produce hits.
* Updated tests.
* Updated docs.


November 24, 2014 Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* CoincidenceAfterProcessing moved to trigger-sim.

October 21, 2014 Juan Carlos Diaz Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Copied PolyplopiaPrimary object to new frame.
* Added method to copy additional DAQ frame objects that are not explicitly handled by CoincidenceAfterProcessing
  into resulting split Q-frame.

August 11, 2014 Juan Carlos Diaz Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Now supports mctypes that include the generator (i.e. 'nuge_numu' instead of just 'numu')

June 30, 2014 Juan Carlos Diaz Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Includes support for MCPEs. Events are merged by combining MCPE's instead of I3MCHits. 
* I3Particle->MCPE map is rebuilt after coincidenceAfterProcessing is run so we know 
  where PE's came from.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected the multiplicity counter to include the primary or signal track in the count. For NuGen events this means
that neutrinos with no CR background events will have a multiplicity value equal to 1.

August 23, 2012 Juan Carlos Diaz Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Added support for merging coincidents events when the primary is a weighted CORSIKA shower.
This implies changes to both python/eventmerger.py and CoincidentAfterProcessing.cxx. eventmerger.poissonmerger 
now adds a copy of the primary particle labeled PolyplopiaPrimary to the frame in order to identify it in the 
post-processing. I have also added some log_fatal checks for missing frame objects in order to prevent obscure 
segmentation faults.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains a bugfix to the expanding coincidence window and the 
addtion of a new module CoincidenceAfterProcessing. The coincidence window should
check if ther is a hit from a new event within 10us after the last hit in the existing series.
The CoincidenceAfterProcessing module will split events if the individual triggers they 
produce are separated in time and will remove, in the case of NuGen, any event that do not 
contain a neutrino. It should be run after the individual triggers have been run.

Going to get serious about release notes for individual projects.
