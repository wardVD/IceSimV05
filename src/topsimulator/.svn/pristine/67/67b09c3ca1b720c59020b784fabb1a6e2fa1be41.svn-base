Release Notes
=============

trunk
-----

* Added I3TopAddComponentWaveforms, a module to add "waveforms" corresponding to the classification of air shower particles in components.
* Added an ExtendedI3Particle class that includes a data member for air shower component it belongs to.

V01-01-02
---------

* renamed sim-icetop.py -> sim_icetop.py and sim-single-particles.py -> sim_single_particles.py
* Add the option to adjust the observation level in I3CorsikaInjector.
  This is to avoid injecting particles under the top of the snow.

V01-01-00
---------

* Added importance sampling algorithm to be used for low-energy showers.
  To use the algorithm, set the ImportanceSampling parameter in I3CorsikaInjector.
* Added sim-icetop.py and sim-single-particles.py to resources/scripts.
  These can be used for general simulations.
