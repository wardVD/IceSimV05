Introduction
============

Genie is a neutrino generator produced originally by Dr. Costas Andreopoulos.
On the main site (http://www.genie-mc.org) it is described as follows:

    GENIE is a suite of products (Generator, Comparisons, Tuning) for the
    experimental neutrino community. It is supported and developed by an
    international collaboration of scientists. The well-known Generator
    implements a modern framework for neutrino Monte Carlos and includes
    state-of-the-art physics modules. The GENIE physics model is universal
    and comprehensive: It handles all neutrinos and targets, and all
    processes relevant from MeV to PeV energy scales. The Generator
    includes several tools (flux drivers, detector geometry navigators,
    specialized event generation apps, event reweighting engines) to
    simulate complex experimental setups in full detail and to support
    generator-related analysis tasks. The GENIE Generator is used by
    several neutrino experiments and its predictions serve as standard
    reference points for the neutrino community. The Comparisons product
    includes extensive curated archives of neutrino, charged-lepton and
    hadron-nucleus scattering data, as well as software to produce a
    comprehensive set of data/MC comparisons. Finally, the Tuning
    product implements a generator tuning framework and includes
    applications implementing the GENIE tuning procedure.

The genie-icetray project was created by Claudio Kopper to allow the
use of Genie within the IceCube simulation framework.
